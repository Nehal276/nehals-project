                This dramatic shot portrays the idea of individual perception. The eye is at the centre which instantly gives the idea of 
                perspective. The image in a way draws attention or focus towards the eye with the help of the circular frame. This gives sense
                of looking through a lens into a different viewpoint. Various shades of colours around the lens add an element of subjectivity. 
                Each colour represents different emotions and thoughts. These thoughts that vary from person to person.

                The surrounding of this image is intentionally kept blurred with some abstract colours and objects to show the sense of being 
                viewed with a unique individual perspective. This is to suggest that what we see is filtered due to our own unique thought process.

                This image was taken at night when I rushed to the kitchen for a glass and some other materials when I got this creative idea.
                 I took one of my paintings, book, and glass to make this happen. This image was also shot on OnePlus 7T. I shot it in portrait 
                 mode. The ISO is kept as 250 to get more light as it was quite dark. Aperture and focal length were adjusted to focus on the 
                 painting through the lens. Its usually adjusted to this for portrait mode. One of the limitations while using smartphones. 
                 This picture did not need much editing apart from brightness and a bit of spot healing.

                I recently had the opportunity of using the green room in the University of Limerick library for Photography. 
                This business-type headshot was clicked in the green room where two ring lights were used to get a perfect lighting set-up. 
                The ring lights were placed in such a way that it will cast a gentle shadow on the right side of my face. This helps in giving 
                the image more of a 3D effect. When it comes to image editing, it was only used to remove hair frizz and adjusting hair placement.
                Other than this the GIMP software was only used to touch up certain flaws on my face. Lastly, the brightness of the image 
                was adjusted slightly according to personal preference.

                Furthermore, it we talk about the mood of the photo then it is very calm with a proper back-straight posture.  The background 
                is kept very neutral to highlight the subject. This helps in keeping the picture simple as well.

                Moving forward, this image was captured on OnePlus 7T camera and the ISO was kept as 125 to get the correct exposure. Not too
                bright or dark and with perfect shadows. Increasing or decreasing the ISO any more than 125 was leading to losing some details 
                of the image. The aperture of this image was set to f/1.65 to get the perfect amount of light. It helped in achieving shallow 
                depth and making the background a bit blurry. Since this was shot on a phone the subject was able to be in focus even with a 
                wide aperture like f/1.65. This image was also clicked in portrait mode with an aperture of 4.76mm. The focal length is so 
                small as smartphones have a larger depth of field due to their smaller sensors and short focal lengths.

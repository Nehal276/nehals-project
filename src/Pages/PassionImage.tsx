                This image depicts my personality and passion in life very well. It reflects my journey towards growth and self-discovery. 
                I as a person feel very small and now as a part of getting out of my comfort zone, I am moving forward and exploring new countries.

                The low angle, with me stepping forward, shows the guts and courage it takes to break free from the comfort zone and face the 
                world. The small building and vast sky show the feeling of the moving forward and suggests the determination to embrace new 
                experiences. The road shows the way towards many new things and difficulties that will come along the way.

                This photography took place at limerick city centre in the evening with OnePlus 7T camera. It held quite low on the road to get 
                this angle and perfect background as well. The ISO is set to 100 for less exposure. Aperture and focal length are similar to 
                other photos showcased in my blog due to similar reasons. Moving forward to image editing for this photo, then it did not need 
                much editing other than levels and saturation. I even highlighted the yellow markers on the road in GIMP for better effect.
